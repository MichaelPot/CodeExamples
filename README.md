# CodeExamples
h4cku is a project I worked on that emulates a gradebook system for schools/classes. A verified user would be able to create a gradebook and then add or delete entries in that gradebook. We had to make it secure and another group would try to break/hack it.

GameCode is code from the game I am currently working on.
